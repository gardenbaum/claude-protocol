## Why

Claude Code loses context. Plans disappear after compaction. Tasks are forgotten between sessions. Changes go straight to main with no traceability.

Claude Protocol fixes this with three things:

- **Beads** — persistent task tracking. One task = one worktree = one PR. Survives restarts and compaction.
- **Hooks** — enforcement, not instructions. Edits on main are blocked. Completion without checklist is blocked. `git --no-verify` is blocked.
- **bd prime** — session start hook loads recent beads so state survives context loss.

Constraints over instructions. What's blocked can't be ignored.

## Origin

A ground-up rewrite with its own architecture and philosophy. See [decisions.md](docs/decisions.md) for the full rationale. Prior-art credits are listed at the [bottom](#credits).

## What Changed in v3

### v3.3.0 (2026-04-22)

- **Upgrade mechanism** — new `npx @gardenbaum/claude-protocol upgrade` command with
  `--dry-run` and `--all <parent>` for batch runs across workspaces. Every
  removal is backed up to `.claude/.upgrades/<timestamp>/`.
- **Memory system removed** — `knowledge.jsonl`, `memory-capture.cjs`, and
  `recall.cjs` are gone. bd's native `bd remember` / `bd memories` takes
  over. Legacy files are cleaned up automatically during upgrade.
- **bd 1.0.2 compatibility** — bd repo moved to gastownhall; install URLs
  updated. Workflow no longer uses the obsolete `inreview` status.
- **Path traversal guard** — upgrade never writes or deletes outside the
  project directory.

Stripped everything that doesn't improve output. Added everything that does.

**Removed:**
- 5 specialized agents (Scout, Detective, Architect, Scribe, Discovery) — duplicated built-in Claude Code capabilities
- Per-tech supervisor generation — 500+ lines of context per stack, Claude already knows these technologies
- Agent personas ("Rex the reviewer") — based on outdated prompting patterns, just fills context
- MCP Provider Delegator, Kanban UI, Web Interface Guidelines — unnecessary infrastructure
- 19 bash hooks — replaced with cross-platform Node.js hooks

**Added:**
- Checklist verification — hook blocks completion if requirements from description aren't checked off
- Session-start orchestration — merged-worktree ACTION REQUIRED, open PRs, dirty-main warning (bd prime owns bead workflow context)
- Mandatory size check — automatic decision: single bead or epic with children
- Plan-to-beads requirement — all planned tasks must be created as beads before implementation starts
- LEARNED quality enforcement — specific format: problem → solution → context
- Safe install and upgrade — SHA-256 manifest tracks user modifications, `--force` for clean reinstall
- bd command reference in rules — prevents Claude from inventing nonexistent commands

**Changed:**
- Rules are trigger-based ("when you create an API endpoint → add logging") instead of reference documents
- Knowledge base search is mandatory before every investigation
- Dev rules (implementation, logging, TDD) included by default

## How It Works

.beads/                     # Task database
```

### Safe for existing projects — and for upgrades

First install and re-install use the same command: `npx @gardenbaum/claude-protocol init`.

- **Hooks and skills** — always updated to the latest version (enforcement code).
- **Rules and agents** — updated only if you haven't modified them. Modified files are preserved; the new version is saved to `.claude/.upgrades/` for manual review.
- **CLAUDE.md** — beads section appended if missing. Original content preserved.
- **settings.json** — hooks merged by event type. Your existing hooks stay.
- **.gitignore** — missing entries appended. Nothing removed.

Use `--force` to overwrite all files regardless of modifications.

### What happens at session start

Every time you start Claude Code, the `session-start` hook shows:

- **`bd prime`** (bd's own hook) — beads workflow context, ready work, and persistent memories; re-injected after compaction
- **ACTION REQUIRED** — merged worktrees with unclosed beads
- **Open PRs** — your PRs awaiting review
- **Dirty main** — warns if the main working tree has uncommitted changes

No manual checking. Context is rebuilt automatically.

### Project discovery

After installation, run `/project-discovery` in Claude Code. It scans your codebase and writes `.claude/rules/project-conventions.md` with:

- Tech stack and frameworks detected
- Naming conventions and patterns
- Testing setup and commands
- Anti-patterns specific to your project

This file is auto-loaded into every agent context. No per-tech supervisor generation needed.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- Node.js 20+
- git

### Install

```bash
npx @gardenbaum/claude-protocol init
```

Restart Claude Code. Run `/project-discovery`.

### Options

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--project-dir PATH` | Target directory (default: current) |
| `--project-name NAME` | Project name for CLAUDE.md (auto-inferred from package.json / pyproject.toml / Cargo.toml / go.mod) |
| `--no-rules` | Skip dev rules (implementation, logging, TDD, resilience) |
| `--force` | Overwrite all files, including user-modified (for clean reinstall) |

### Local development (before npm publish)

```bash
cd /path/to/claude-protocol && npm link
npx @gardenbaum/claude-protocol init  # works in any project
```

### Vendored Beads docs

The current `bd` reference is vendored under `docs/vendor/beads/` (committed, offline) so the
`beads-workflow` rule can be kept accurate against real `bd` behavior. Start at the relevance
triage in [`docs/beads-reading-guide.md`](docs/beads-reading-guide.md); refresh to the latest
upstream with `mise run docs-sync-beads`. Not shipped to npm — it lives only in this repo.

## Upgrade

Existing projects upgrade safely — user-modified files are preserved; only
claude-protocol's own artifacts are cleaned up.

### Preview (recommended first)

```bash
npx @gardenbaum/claude-protocol@latest upgrade --dry-run
```

Prints the exact list of files, directories, and settings-hook entries that
would change. Touches nothing.

### Apply

```bash
npx @gardenbaum/claude-protocol@latest upgrade
```

Runs the init flow and then strips obsolete artifacts. Every removal is
backed up under `.claude/.upgrades/<UTC-timestamp>/` so you can roll back by
copying files out of the backup directory.

### Batch (multiple projects)

```bash
npx @gardenbaum/claude-protocol@latest upgrade --all /path/to/parent
```

Iterates every direct subdirectory of the parent that contains a `.beads/`
folder and upgrades each one. Combine with `--dry-run` to audit before
applying.

### Rollback

The backup directory `.claude/.upgrades/<timestamp>/obsolete/` mirrors the
project tree. Copy the file(s) you want back into place. Nothing is ever
hard-deleted.

## Workflow

### Every task goes through beads

```
Plan → Size check → Create beads → bd ready → Dispatch → Worktree → PR → Merge → Close
```

**Size check** runs automatically before creating beads:
- More than 3 files or multiple domains (DB + API + frontend) → epic with children
- More than 50 lines estimated → consider splitting
- Otherwise → single bead

One bead = one worktree = one PR = one reviewable diff.

### Parallel work

```bash
bd dep add TASK-2 TASK-1    # TASK-2 is blocked by TASK-1
bd close TASK-1              # TASK-2 becomes ready
bd ready                     # shows all unblocked tasks
```

Orchestrator dispatches all ready tasks in parallel via `Task()`.

### Quick fix

For changes under 10 lines on a feature branch. Hard blocked on main.

```bash
git checkout -b fix-typo     # must be off main
# edit → hook asks for confirmation → commit
```

### Completion verification

Subagents are blocked from finishing unless:
- Completion report present (`BEAD {ID} COMPLETE` + worktree)
- `Checklist:` section present with all `[x]` items checked
- Code committed and pushed from the worktree
- Comment left on bead
- Response within verbosity limits (25 lines / 1200 chars)

## Hooks

| Hook | Event | Enforcement |
|------|-------|-------------|
| enforce-branch-before-edit | PreToolUse (Edit/Write) | Blocks edits on main. Asks confirmation on feature branches with file name and change size. |
| bash-guard | PreToolUse (Bash) | Blocks `--no-verify` and raw `git worktree add`. Requires description on `bd create`. Validates epic close (all children done, PR merged). |
| validate-completion | SubagentStop | Checks completion report, checklist, comment, worktree committed + pushed, verbosity. |
| session-start | SessionStart | Orchestration status: dirty-main warning, merged-worktree ACTION REQUIRED, open PRs. (bd's own `bd prime` hook injects beads workflow context.) |
| nudge-claude-md-update | PreCompact | Reminds to update CLAUDE.md before context compaction. |
| hook-utils | — | Shared utilities: getField, parseBeadId, deny/ask/block, execCommand. |

## Dev Rules

Included by default. Skip with `--no-rules`.

| Rule | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| implementation-standard | Dev process with user confirmation. Code metrics (function < 30 lines, class < 200, nesting < 4). Self-review with `/simplify` trigger. |
| logging-standard | Trigger-based: "creating API endpoint → add logging". Covers external calls, payments, auth, background jobs. Sentry + Seq. |
| tdd-workflow | Trigger-based: "new function → write test first". RED → GREEN → REFACTOR cycle. Clear exceptions (configs, DTOs, migrations). |
| resilience-standard | Trigger-based: "calling external API → what if timeout/5xx?". Covers DB, payments, files, background jobs. Strategies: retry, fallback, circuit breaker, compensation. |

## FAQ

**Q: `bd init` hangs during installation.**
A: Dolt server is not running. Bootstrap creates `.beads/` manually after 15s timeout. Run `bd init` later when Dolt is available, or use SQLite backend.

**Q: Hooks don't work after installation.**
A: Restart Claude Code. Hooks load from `settings.json` at startup.

**Q: Claude invents commands like `bd export`.**
A: `beads-workflow.md` includes a full command reference table. If Claude still invents commands, it didn't read the rules — check that `.claude/rules/` exists.

**Q: What happens if I run `init` again after updating claude-protocol?**
A: Modified rules and agents are preserved — new versions go to `.claude/.upgrades/` for you to review. Hooks and skills are always updated. Use `--force` for a clean reinstall.

**Q: Can I use this without Dolt?**
A: Yes. Beads works with SQLite by default. Dolt adds version history and branching for the task database.

**Q: How do beads sync across machines / get backed up?**
A: `init` wires the Dolt remote to your `origin` and installs shared git hooks. At
task completion the agent runs `bd dolt push` (one prescribed step) to push the bead
database (history under `refs/dolt/data` on origin) — this is the deterministic sync
so reviewers and fresh clones see your beads. On the receiving side `git pull` fires
the committed post-merge hook to pull Dolt; `dolt.auto-push=true` is also set but is
only eventual, so the explicit `bd dolt push` is what guarantees delivery. A readable
`.beads/issues.jsonl` is committed as a backup. On a fresh clone run `bd bootstrap` to
pull the bead history.
